\format{An object of class \code{GeomWtg} (inherits from \code{Geom}, \code{ggproto}, \code{gg}) of length 7.}
\usage{
geom_wtg(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, border_col = "white",
  border_size = 0.125, na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)

\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{aes()} or
\code{aes_()}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{ggplot()}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{fortify()} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame.}, and
will be used as the layer data.}

\item{border_col}{border color of the country squares, default "\code{white}"}

\item{border_size}{thickness of the square country borders}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{borders()}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{layer()}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\description{
Pass in a data frame of countries (iso2c, i23c, name) and a value column and
get back a world tile grid. You don't need to have all countries in your
original data set, but this is a world tile grid and only having a few
countries may not make sense for the message you're trying to convey.
}
\details{
Labeling world tile grids is a tricksy business and no labeling
parameters are planned for this since you should think very carefully about
the tradeoffs of tiny text/numbers vs readability. These charts are really
only good for overviews in single-chart form or highlighting stark differences
in panel-form. See the section on \code{Computed variables} for data that is
available to be used as labels.
\cr
There are two special/critical \code{aes()} mappings:
\itemize{
\item \code{country} (so the geom knows which column to map the country names/abbrevs to)
\item \code{fill} (which column you're mapping the filling for the squares with)
}
}
